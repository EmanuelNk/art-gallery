This portrait is such a monumental moment for me as an artist, and contains lots of sentimental value. Not only is it representing the beautiful love of two people (my parents), but representing several milestones in my personal life. This is my first ever portrait created in my first apartment, and my first ever portrait containing two very detailed faces! The little 12 year old me would be blown away by the progress I've made as an artist, and I can confidently say I'm proud.

G-d willing this is just the beginning of many more works of art being produced in this lovely apartment. And to many more years of growth as an artist and a person! Never give up on things you're passionate about, and keep working hard! Practice doesn't ever make perfect, practice makes progress (and that's much more valuable).
